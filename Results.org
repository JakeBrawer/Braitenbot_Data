However, the effect of selection on each character,\beta, differed with Treatment level across generations (Figure X). In the competitive group, the \beta values converged on vaciliating on zero with subsequent generations. The beta values for wires appeared to more or less track the behavior of wire number across generations (figure X c); at generation, the peak number of wires,  \beta_{wires}  significantly positive (/p/ < .05; ANOVA). From generation 2 to generationn 5,both \beta_{wire} and number of wires decrease,  though both trend positively from generation 6 to 7. For the cooperative group, \beta_{wire} did not follow this pattern, but rather remained mostly negative with the exception of a sharp positive spike at generation 4. The does not track the path of cooperative groups mean number of wire, which consistently decreases, implying that selection was driving wire count the competitive group more so than in the cooperative group. 

\beta{crossover} for the competitive group remained mostly positive, though hovered close to zero. At gen 5 and gen 7 \beta was positive (/p/ <. 05) with slightly positive magnitudes. For the cooperative group, \beta
